## General Information
Hi! This is the repo for group 58's project for Intro to Databases. It's reliant on a database hosted by Oregon State University, so its functionality may be affected after the course ends. This website lets you interact with a bird rehabilitation's patient database website, making new entries, editing, updating, deleting, and resetting the database.
